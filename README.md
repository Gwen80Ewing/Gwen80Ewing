## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a cloud-native developer focused on building scalable, event-driven applications using serverless technologies across AWS and Google Cloud Platform. My work centers on leveraging the flexibility and efficiency of the cloud to deliver resilient, low-maintenance solutions that respond dynamically to real-world workloads.

With a strong background in cloud architecture and infrastructure-as-code, I specialize in designing microservices and event-based systems using tools like AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, and Firestore. I enjoy creating modular, production-ready applications that scale automatically, reduce operational overhead, and minimize costs without compromising performance.

My development approach emphasizes automation, observability, and secure design. I rely heavily on services like CloudFormation, Terraform, and the Serverless Framework to streamline deployment pipelines and enforce consistent infrastructure standards. Logging, monitoring, and alerting are also integral parts of my workflows, often implemented through tools like CloudWatch, Stackdriver, and custom dashboards.

This repository is a place where I document my experiments, proof-of-concepts, and projects that explore modern patterns in cloud-native development. From asynchronous task processing to real-time data pipelines and API-first architectures, the code here reflects my interest in solving complex problems with minimal infrastructure friction.

Collaboration and knowledge sharing are important to me, so I welcome contributions, discussions, and feedback. Whether you're a fellow developer interested in cloud-native technologies or someone exploring the potential of serverless computing, I hope you find value in the work shared here.

Feel free to browse the code, raise issues, or open pull requests. Letâ€™s build the future of cloud developmentâ€”one serverless function at a time.
